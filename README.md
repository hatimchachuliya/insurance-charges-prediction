Insurance charges are predicted using various features like  age,sex,bmi,children,smoker,region
By deriving the coorelation from the dataset it is observed that there is a strong relation between charges and the category whether the person is smoker or not (around 70% coorelation)
Algorithim used to predict smoker or not Are KNearestNeighbours (accuracy rate 92%) 
Algorithm USed for predicting the charges Linear Regression ( accuracy rate 77%)
